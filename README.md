Assume that there are two teams and they are team attacker and team defender.  Therefore, at a state of the game one agent in  each team is left alive respectively. Here, the defender is given a lifeline called HP which will be assigned randomly. Furthermore, the attacker agent  will try to give maximum negative HP to the defender agent to decrease his(d) chances of survival in the game. On the other hand, the defender agent will try to protect himself by receiving the lowest negative HP possible from the attacker agent. Furthermore, the attacker can have a choice from a number of bullets from his gun and the optimal moves will cost a certain maximum negative HP (chosen from randomly assigned values within the range of minimum and maximum negative HP). Here, are the following things you need to do using Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm:
